# Scope2Screen 

## About
Scope2Screen is an open-source web-application for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. The client -server application consists of a python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) backend and a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) javascript frontend. The serverâ€™s  restful  API  allows  to  retrieve  image  and  feature  data and to steer analytics.  The frontend is built using Bootstrap, D3.js, and [openseadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), a web-based zoomable imageviewer, which we extend significantly.
